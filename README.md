# Express.JS: Note Taker

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This application can be used to write and save notes; it uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The api and html routes are included in the server.js file instead of the api/controller folder, however these folders and routes have been included to document the troubleshooting process and serve as scafolding for a second, more complex build.
